📜 Python History Quiz CLITest your knowledge of the 20th Century's most defining moments in this interactive, randomized command-line quiz game.📖 Table of ContentsAbout the ProjectKey FeaturesHow It Works (The Logic)Topics IncludedGetting StartedCode StructureRoadmapContributing🧐 About the ProjectThe History Quiz CLI is a lightweight educational tool designed to test your historical knowledge through a terminal interface. Unlike static quizzes, this program utilizes a dynamic randomization engine to ensure that every playthrough feels fresh.Whether you are a history buff or a student studying for an exam, this tool provides a quick and effective way to recall key dates, figures, and events from World War I, World War II, and the Cold War.🚀 Key Features🔀 Dynamic Randomization:Each topic contains a robust pool of 10 questions.The system randomly selects 5 unique questions for every session.Result: No two quiz sessions are exactly the same!📊 Score Tracking:Real-time feedback on every answer ("CORRECT" vs "WRONG").Calculates and displays a final score (e.g., 4 OUT OF 5) at the end of the round.🛡️ Robust Input Handling:Validates user choices (a/b/c/d) to prevent crashes.Simple, text-based navigation.🧠 Beginner-Friendly Codebase:Built entirely with standard Python libraries.Uses transparent if/elif logic, making it perfect for students learning to code.🛠️ How It Works (The Logic)This program avoids complex database dependencies by using Python's built-in random module. Here is the step-by-step flow:Topic Selection: The user selects a specific era (e.g., World War 2).Random Sampling: The script calls random.sample([1...10], 5). This generates a list of 5 unique integers between 1 and 10 (e.g., [3, 9, 1, 5, 8]).Question Retrieval: The program loops through these 5 integers. Inside the loop, a structure of if/elif statements maps each integer to a specific text question and its correct answer.Scoring: If the user's input matches the correct key, the score variable increments.📋 Topics IncludedTopicDescriptionStatusWorld War 1Trench warfare, The Treaty of Versailles, Assassinations.✅ ActiveWorld War 2D-Day, The Holocaust, The Pacific Theater, Key Generals.✅ ActiveCold WarThe Space Race, Cuban Missile Crisis, Berlin Wall, Proxy Wars.✅ ActiveIndo-Pakistan WarsKey conflicts and treaties in the subcontinent.🚧 Coming Soon💻 Getting StartedPrerequisitesPython 3.6 or higher installed on your machine.Installation & RunClone the Repositorygit clone [https://github.com/your-username/history-quiz-cli.git](https://github.com/your-username/history-quiz-cli.git)

📝 Code StructureWe prioritize readability over complexity. Here is a snippet showing how questions are selected and displayed:import random

# 1. Select 5 unique ID numbers from a pool of 10
questions = random.sample([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 5)

# 2. Iterate through the selected IDs
for q in questions:
    if q == 1:
        print("QUESTION TEXT HERE...")
        # Check answer logic
    elif q == 2:
        print("NEXT QUESTION TEXT HERE...")
        # Check answer logic
